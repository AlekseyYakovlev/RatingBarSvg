# RatingBarSvg    
This is an example of using a custom rating bar with vector drawable support.

<p align="center">
  <img width="324" height="576" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlekseyYakovlev/RatingBarSvg/master/RatingBarSvgDemo.png">
</p>

To use additional features like drawableHeight, drawableWidth & innerPadding from XML, you should declare them in values\attr.xml.
